                                    I am currently a senior in computer science at North Carolina State University and I will be graduating in Fall 2017.
                                    I was previously a teaching assistant for CSC 116 (Introduction to Java) working under Dr. Schmidt and Ms. ToniAnn Marini.
                                    I also worked as a Computer Science Research Assistant under Dr. Schmidt and Dr. Heckman where we researched on how we could improve
                                    teaching CSC 116 and how to gamify both CSC 116 and CSC 216
                                    This past summer I was a Software Engineer Intern at Blackbaud.

                                            During my internship at Blackbaud, I developed on Blackbaud's leading product - <b>Financial Edge 7</b>.
                                            I added data analytics by implementing Mixpanel into FE7 with Visual Basic 6 in order to understand
                                            how customers utilize FE7. After implementing data analytics into FE7 my implementation was adopted by 
                                            two other leading products at Blackbaud - <b>Raiser's Edge</b> and <b>Education Edge</b>.<br /><br />

                                            After finishing my main summer project I worked on a team of 8 in an agile envrionment where we developed on
                                            Financial Edge NXT where I focused on non-profit intelligence and financial data analysis.<br /><br />

                                            During this internship I learned and solidified VB6, C#, SQL, javascript, jquery, angular, and other web technologies.

                                <span class="indent">
                                    Overview:<br />
                                    Over the course of a semester in Software Engineerings (CSC 326)  our team performed improvements on iTrust - a program 
                                    that has been worked on by previous CSC students at NCSU over the past decade. Our team competed with other teams in the 
                                    class where we all completed the same requirements in order to create the best iTrust project for that semester. At the 
                                    end of the semester our project was selected as best in the class after we presented our project in front of both our lab and our entire class.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Goal:<br />
                                    Use JSF (Java Server Framework) to implement five additional use cases, refactor logging, secure SQL connections 
                                    with prepared statements, implement mocking through Mockito for proper unit testing, and create a docker image. 
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Process: <br />
                                    The process involved 5 iterations where our team worked in an agile environment. We would meet twice a week
                                    and have stand up meetings to describe where we were on the project and what help, if any, was needed. We 
                                    managed the project through GitHub where we decided to utiulze merge requests to code review our merges 
                                    and GitHub issues that we could close as we finished our assignments.

                                    Door To More was created in 24 hours to benefit advocacy organizations that would employ individuals to canvass
                                    door to door or on the street to raise awareness, soulcit donations, and add to in-house files. The purpose of the
                                    app is to create a streamulned interface where canvassers can quickly create new constituents and document the interaction
                                    in a way that advocacy organizations can aggregate or target these constituents in the future.

                                    As I was learning html, css, javascript, angularjs, and other web technologies during my internship at Blackbaud I decided to
                                    create this website to souldify what I was using. This website is intended to give a quick overview of my resume in a web format
                                    and provide ulnks to other personal websites while having a friendly UI that can be accessed on phone or pc.Through this websites

                                    Overall, this project has taught me how to AngularJS works as I threw myself into using it. I better understand modules, controllers, 
                                    routing, and services with angular and I am proud at the modular components I have been able to make.

                                    This java program was developed to quickly anonymize student files by removing identifying information such as email,
                                    names, and @author tags and replacing them with encrypted ids generated by the research director.
                                    As the program parses through student files it creates new anonymized files and saves the new files into a directory
                                    called Anon_Submissions while preserving the old copies of the files.

                                    During Java 2 I decided to supplement what I learned by diving in Android development. I decided to adapt a project I was working on
                                    in the class into an app. This app is intended to test your knowledge of movies. The better that you do the harder the questions become. Are you up to the challenge?
